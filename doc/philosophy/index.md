title: The Philosophy Behind MMT
---

MMT goes back to and builds on [omdoc](OMDoc).

It shares much of the motivation of OMDoc of building a semantics-oriented representation format and ontology language for mathematical knowledge.
But MMT goes beyond the original OMDoc language by a strong commitment to rigorously defined semantics and scalable implementations.

More details can be found in the [intros](introductory articles).
