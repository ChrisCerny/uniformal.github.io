title: The OMDoc Format
---

[OMDoc](https://omdoc.org) (Open Mathematical Documents; see the [OMDoc book](http://omdoc.org/pubs/omdoc1.2.pdf) for details)  was developed by Michael Kohlhase.

It can be seen as two things:

* a philosophy of how a uniform language for knowledge should be designed
* an XML format following this philosophy.

MMT fully subscribes to the OMDoc philosophy and can thus be seen as a concrete
incarnation of OMDoc. Currently, MMT covers and heavily redesigns the formal subset of OMDoc
(though work on the informal subset is [currently under way](https://uniformal.github.io/doc/language/informal.html)).

Moreover, MMT has become a major driver of changes to the XML format or its specification.
