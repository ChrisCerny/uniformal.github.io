title: The OMDoc Format
---

[OMDoc](https://trac.omdoc.org/OMDoc) was developed by Michael Kohlhase.

It can be seen as two things:

* a philosophy of how a uniform language for knowledge should be designed
* an XML format following this philosophy.

MMT fully subscribes to the OMDoc philosophy and can thus be seen as a concrete incarnation of OMDoc.

Moreover, MMT has become a major driver of changes to the XML format or its specification.
