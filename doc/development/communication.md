### Mailing lists

The MMT developers maintain the following mailing lists:

* [mmt-users@kwarc.info](http://lists.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/mailman/listinfo/mmt-users)
  Communication between developers and users as well as among unsers. Announcements about MMT (e.g., new releases) as well as any general requests or inquiries. Typically low traffic.
* [mmt-dev@kwarc.info](http://lists.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/mailman/listinfo/mmt-dev)
  Communication between developments. More traffic and more technical.

### Github

MMT is hosted on [github](https://github.com/Uniformal/MMT), and users are encouraged to submit git issues for bug reports, feature requests, etc.
