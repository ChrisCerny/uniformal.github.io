title: Extending MMT
---

MMT systematically abstracts from all aspects that can be reasonably customized by introducing

* an extensible language where operators, typing rules, etc. can be added declaratively,
* abstract interfaces in a way that allows users to replace virtually all components of MMT with their own variants,
* rule-based algorithms that can be customized by supplying a different set of rules.
