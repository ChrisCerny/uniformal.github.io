title: Contribute to MMT
---

MMT is open to the community, and access to the GitHub repository is given generously.

However, there is a bit of a learning curve.
Therefore, interested developers are advised and encouraged to contact the core [contributors] directly.

Moreover, MMT is designed to be extremely [extensible](extend).
Typical users of MMT will be able to include the MMT library into stand-alone projects.
