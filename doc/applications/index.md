## Features and Applications
MMT is an API and thus [application-independent](../philosophy/independence.html).
Individual applications are either part of the mmt-api project or implemented in separate projects.
In particular, these include

* a [shell](shell.html)
* an [IDE](jedit.html) based on the jEdit text editor
* a [build tool](building.html) for [MMT archives](archives.html)
* a [graphical interface](gui.html)
* an [HTTP interface](server.html)
* a [web site](server.html) for browsing MMT content

The [MMT API](../api/) Based on MMT provides a number of knowledge management services including

* notation-based presentation,
* interactive web-browisng,
* MMT-aware databases with custom indexing and retrieval,
* project-based abstraction and work flows for building, distribution, and sharing,
* management of change,
* querying integrating hierarchic, relational, and unification-based paradigms,
* the universal OpenMath machine based on registering custom implementations with the MMT server.
