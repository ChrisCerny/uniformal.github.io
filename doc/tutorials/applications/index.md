title: Application Development with MMT
---

In this tutorial, we show how to build a few simple applications on top of the MMT library.

It assumes that

* MMT has been [installed](../../setup),
* archives are placed in some folder, which is refered to as `CONTENT`,
* [jEdit](../../applications/jedit) is used for editing mmt files.<span class="detail">Other editors will work but might make editing awkward.</span>

All applications focus on simplicity in order to show the general principles.

This tutorial uses the Exporter extension to tranform MMT content into other formats.
Concretely, we export MMT theories as OpenMath content dictionaries.
