title: Writing MMT documents with jEdit
---

In this tutorial, we will write a couple of MMT theories using the [MMT language](../../language/); specifically, we will use [jEdit](../../applications/jedit.html) to specify the syntax and proof theory of first-order logic, a simple type theory and views between them using the logical framework LF. This entails creating and [building](../../applications/building.html) [archives](../../applications/archives.html) and browsing them using the MMT [web page](../../applications/server.html).

### Preliminaries

You should have MMT and jEdit downloaded and installed according to the instructions [here](../../setup/). We will assume, that the directory structure is as recommended there. Furthermore, we will use LF, which is provided by the archive [urtheories](https://gl.mathhub.info/MMT/urtheories) available on [mathhub](../../applications/oaf.html). So this archive needs to be in the `MMT/content` directory.
