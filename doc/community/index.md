Currently substantial contributions are being made by [Dennis MÃ¼ller](https://github.com/Jazzpirate), and [Tom Wiesing](https://github.com/tkw1536).

### Mailing lists

The MMT developers maintain the following mailing lists:

* [mmt-users@kwarc.info](http://lists.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/mailman/listinfo/mmt-users)
  Communication between developers and users as well as among users. Announcements about MMT (e.g., new releases) as well as any general requests or inquiries. Typically low traffic.
* [mmt-dev@kwarc.info](http://lists.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/mailman/listinfo/mmt-dev)
  Communication between developments. More traffic and more technical.

### Developer/User Wiki

For common error messages and their solution, some F.A.Q.s and miscellaneous helpful blobs of information that are not quite relevant or polished enough for this documentation,
we also have a [Wiki](https://github.com/UniFormal/uniformal.github.io/wiki).

### Github

MMT is hosted on [github](https://github.com/Uniformal/MMT), and users are encouraged to submit git issues for bug reports, feature requests, etc.
