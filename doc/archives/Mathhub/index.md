title: Installing and Publishing Archives with MathHub.info
---

[MathHub.info](http://mathhub.info) is portal for active mathematical documents and
archive for flexiformal mathematics. It hosts most MMT content in the form of
[math archives](archives) and makes it accessible to human readers in the
form of active documents.

MathHub stores its contents in the GitLab repository http://gl.mathhub.info and provides
mathematical knowledge management services and presentations via
[a dedicated MMT process](http://mmt.mathhub.info).

The [MathHub Wiki](https://github.com/MathHubInfo/Documentation/wiki) gives details about the
system. 

Archives can be installed and updated from as well as published to Mathhub using 
the [Local Mathhub Tool (LMH)](lmh.html). In addition Mathhub hosts an 
[MMT-server](doc/applications/server.html) and an instance of 
[TGView](doc/applications/tgview.html) to explore and visualize archives.
