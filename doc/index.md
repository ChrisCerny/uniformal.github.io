title: Starting point
---

This is the main entry point to the MMT documentation. It contains:

* instructions for how to [download](setup/index#download), [install](setup/index#installation), [build](setup/build), [run](setup/running), and [configure](setup/jedit#configuration) MMT
* a list of [applications/interfaces](applications/) based on or included in the MMT API - each with its installation instructions
* some *demos and screenshots(TODO)* of MMT-based [applications](system/applications/)
* some [MMT archives](applications/oaf.html) that can be imported or used as examples
* an overview of the structure of the MMT [repository](setup/build/repo.html)
* a list of [research articles](about/papers.html) about MMT
* an overview of the [MMT language](language/)
* an overview of the [MMT API](api/)
* A few [tutorials](tutorials/) for specific applications

[This paper](https://svn.kwarc.info/repos/MMT/doc/introduction/mmt.pdf) can serve as a brief introduction.

**Disclaimer**: I am developing MMT essentially alone, and I do not have the time to maintain a professional work flow for releasing, documenting, and bug-tracking. MMT is primarily an academic system although it is becoming more and more practical. 

For feedback and questions, I am almost always [reachable](http://kwarc.info/frabe/contact.html) and usually very responsive.
