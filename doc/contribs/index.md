Sometimes helpful articles do not immediately fit anywhere in the structure of this documentation.
This folder allows making these articles available while they await integration with the rest of the documentation.

To add an article, simply edit this file by inserting a link to a new file in the same folder.
Then create and edit that file.

Here is a link to a [template](template.html) that you can copy.
Note that the files are .md files, but the links must be to the .html files, which will be generated when the documentation is built.

If you do not have write access to the documentation, just request it from one of the developers (or make a pull request).
