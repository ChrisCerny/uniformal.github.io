# Licensing

## Licenses and Exceptions
The MMT system is licensed under the [Afferro Gnu Public License (AGPL)](/doc/legal/license.html)).
Contributors electronically sign a Contributor License Agreement ([CLA](#cla-submission)), which gives the [Uniformal Foundation](/doc/legal/foundation.html) the right to re-license or make execptions to AGPL for research partners who need them as long as an open source version of MMT remains.

## License Requirements Analysis
The licensing structure above was selected to implement the following requirements
1. don't scare away possible users (researchers and collaboration partners)
2. entice upstreaming of changes
3. don't restric oustide usage of MMT
4. know our users
5. establish revenue streams for MMT sustainability

We find the best way of implementing them is to have a restrictive "default license" (here the AGPL) and liberally give out exceptions to the default license.

## License Exception Invitation 
If you think you need a license exception, contact the  [Uniformal Foundation](/doc/legal/foundation.html). 
We are committed to accomodate any reasonable need.
