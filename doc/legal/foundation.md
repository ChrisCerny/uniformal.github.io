# The Uniformal Foundation

The Uniformal Foundation is an informal association with the purpose of dealing with [licensing issues for the MMT system](licensing).
For simplicity, it is currently not a formally registered legal entity, but could be incorporated at any point in the future (probably as soon as it needs to handle any non-trivial amount of money or enters contracts with external parties).

## Charter

### 0.  Purpose
The Uniformal Foundation represents the community of MMT developers and users and deals with strategic decisions about the MMT system, in particular its licensing.

### 1. Membership

The SC keeps a membership roster. Any contributor to or user of the MMT ecosystem -- in the form of code or content -- can apply for membership.
Membership applications are decided by the SC.
Membership can be terminated by the member's request to the SC or by decision by the SC.

The SC maintains a mailing list of all members.

The SC convenes a members' meeting (MM) at least annually. The MM should take the form of a retreat or workshop but may also take place online if expedient.

The SC informs the MM and the MM advises the SC on all issues.

In particular, the MM
1. approves charter changes proposed by the SC,
2. approves licensing decisions proposed by the SC,
3. elects additional SC members.

All members have one vote at the MM, and the MM decides by majority vote.

### 2.  Steering Committee (SC)

The SC takes all decisions of the Uniformal Foundation except for those that must be made or approved by the MM.
Whenever feasible, it seeks the advice of the members before making decisions, and it communicates all decisions to the members swiftly.

All SC decisions are made unanimously.

The SC consists of 
* Florian Rabe (the main MMT developer)
* Michael Kohlhase (head of the KWARC group) 
* one member elected by the MM for a term of 2 years
