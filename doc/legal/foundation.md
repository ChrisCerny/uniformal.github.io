title: The Uniformal Foundation

The Uniformal Foundation is an informal association with the purpose of dealing with licensing issues for the MMT system.
For simplicity, it is currently not a formally registered legal entity, but could be incorporated at any point in the future (probably as soon as it needs to handle any non-trivial amount of money).
