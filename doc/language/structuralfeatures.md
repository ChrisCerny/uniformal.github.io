title: Structural Features
---

Structural features are a method to extend the declaration-level MMT syntax. They elaborat derived declarations to an elaboration (a list of external declaration). Their syntax and elaboration are defined in their implementation. 

Examples of structural features include [Inductive Types](inductive.md) and [Record Types](records.md).
