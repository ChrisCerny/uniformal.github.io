title: Structural Features
---

Structural features can be used to extend the declaration-level MMT syntax. They elaborate derived declarations to an elaboration, a list of so-called external declarations. Their syntax and semantics (i.e. elaboration) are defined by their implementation. Structural features are usually implemented as extensions to the MMT API.

Examples of structural features include [Inductive Types](inductive.md) and [Record Types](records.md).
